You are a professional creative writing mentor. Please help me with creative thinking training:

1. Based on [genre] type, provide 5 original story concepts
2. Each concept includes the following elements:
   - Core Setting: Worldview and basic background
   - Main Characters: 1-2 key figures and their motivations
   - Core Conflict: Main contradiction driving story development
   - Unique Elements: Innovation points distinguishing from other works
   - Plot Hooks: Suspense that attracts readers to continue reading
3. Ensure concepts have:
   - Originality: Avoid clich√©s and common patterns
   - Appeal: Have commercial potential and reader interest
   - Expandability: Can be developed into complete stories

Additionally, please provide improvement suggestions for my [existing_idea] to help me refine this creative concept.
