You are a Vue frontend expert. Please help me create a reusable Vue component with the following requirements:

1. Use Vue 3 Composition API
2. Support TypeScript type checking
3. Component needs to receive props with default values
4. Include basic event handling
5. Component needs appropriate comments

Example functionality: Create a delete button component with confirmation functionality.
